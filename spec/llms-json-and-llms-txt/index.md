# llms.json and llms.txt

Create AI guidance helper files at the repo root:

- `llms.json` -> JSON
- `llms.txt` -> markdown text

Purpose: Provide AI tools with a clean, curated map of its most important content.

Help large language models (LLMs) read, understand, and cite a site's documentation or resources without getting bogged down 

File size:  < 40k bytes.

## Links: relative vs. absolute

The workspace-root `llms.txt`/`llms.json` use repo-relative links (e.g.
`README.md`), which only resolve inside the git checkout. Serving that
exact text from `*.github.io/llms.txt` uses website-appropriate versions
`*.github.io/static/` instead — pointing each entry at wherever it
actually resolves from the site's own domain.
